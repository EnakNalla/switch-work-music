# Switch work Music

## About

Designed to be used for cause and effect with an adaptive switch.

## Usage

Set switch to "Space" or "Enter" mode.

Select songs on your computer by pressing "New playlist" button.

When switch is pressed the song will play for the time defined by the timer then stop.

To override you can press the "Esc" key this will pause immediately.

You can customise the visualiser, or turn it of entirely in the Visualiser config section.

If you do not care about miss hit tracking, this can be turned off.

When a song finishes, by default the next song in the list will be loaded.
If shuffle mode is enabled a random song from the list will be chosen.

Saving a config will save the playlist, and all options in the config menus.
